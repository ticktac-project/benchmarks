# UPPAAL models of mutual exclusion on a single line track segment

This directory contains UPPAAL 4.X models of mutual exclusion on a single line
track segment for trains inspired from the model introduced in Section 3.3.3 in:
*Henning Dierks, "Time, Abstraction and Heuristics",
Habilitation Thesis, Department of Computer Science,
University of Oldenburg, 2005 (http://www.avacs.org/Publikationen/Open/dierks05.pdf)*

These models were obtained by application of the translation of PLC automata into timed automata
given in definition 2 from:
*Henning Dierks:
Comparing model checking and logical reasoning for real-time systems. Formal Asp.
 Comput. 16(2): 104-120 (2004)*

- `sts.sh` is inspired from the model introduced in the
article above.
Run `sts.sh` for help on how to build a UPPAAL model from the script.
